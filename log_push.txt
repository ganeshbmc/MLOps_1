Fri Jul 25 19:22:51 UTC 2025 - Trying CI/CD combo pipeline for the first time. Not sure about correct authorizations. Fingers crossed.
Fri Jul 25 19:30:45 UTC 2025 - Second attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. First attempt failed because of wrong path to Dockerfile in build step. Still not sure about correct k8s authorizations. Fingers crossed.
Fri Jul 25 19:41:24 UTC 2025 - Third attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. First two attempts failed because of wrong path to Dockerfile in build step. Still not sure about correct k8s authorizations. Fingers crossed.
Fri Jul 25 19:49:43 UTC 2025 - Fourth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. First three attempts failed because of wrong path to Dockerfile in build step. Still not sure about correct k8s authorizations. Fingers crossed.
Fri Jul 25 19:59:17 UTC 2025 - Fifth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Previous attempts failed because of wrong path to Dockerfile in build step. Still not sure about correct k8s authorizations. Fingers crossed.
Fri Jul 25 20:12:01 UTC 2025 - Sixth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because of incorrect authorizations. Set up a new service account and added the json key to GitHub Actions Secrets.
Fri Jul 25 20:21:19 UTC 2025 - Seventh attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because gke-gcloud-auth-plugin was missing. Edited the test.yml file to install this plugin.
Fri Jul 25 20:26:50 UTC 2025 - Eighth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because gke-gcloud-auth-plugin was missing. Edited the test.yml file to install this plugin using sudo apt-get instead of gcloud components.
Fri Jul 25 20:38:12 UTC 2025 - Ninth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because gke-gcloud-auth-plugin was missing. Rewrote the test.yml file google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2. It simplifies authentications.
Fri Jul 25 20:47:38 UTC 2025 - Tenth attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because gke-gcloud-auth-plugin was missing. Rewrote the test.yml file google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2. But dvc failed. Now set up double auth
Fri Jul 25 20:53:27 UTC 2025 - Eleventh attempt of CI/CD combo pipeline. Docker build worked now! But previous attempt failed because gke-gcloud-auth-plugin was missing. Rewrote the test.yml file google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2. Had made a silly mistake of not removing apt-get cmd in yaml file.
